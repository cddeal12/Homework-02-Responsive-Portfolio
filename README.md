# Homework-02-Responsive-Portfolio
This repository contains three html files, one for each page of my responsive portfolio project.
They are titled index, portfolio, and contact. There is a single css file in the repository that is linked to all three html files. It serves to change specific things outside of the defaults of Bootstrap, such as backgound images and colors. There are also two image files, one .png and one .jpg, used as the background and on the index.html page respectively.

# Formatting
The main challenge in this portfolio project was learning and grappling with Bootstrap and its grid system. Ultimately I was able to use it to shape my content and make it responsive to all screen sizes using Bootstrap's grid and other formatting tools. The content takes up the entire screen at the smallest of sizes (not counting margins or the footer's area), and rests mainly on the left half at the largest screen sizes. This was made possible relatively easily through the grid tools (rows and columns).

# Other Bootstrap
Bootstrap's tools for creating buttons, navs, and forms were also used. The navbar also uses the tools for collapsible navbars, forcing the links into a collapsible menu button at smaller screen sizes. The tools for forms and buttons were used to create the majority of the content on the contact page, and to label each field that users can type into. It is important to note that the form contains a submit button but does not actually function, as the ability to take in the users information is beyond my ability and the scope of this project.
